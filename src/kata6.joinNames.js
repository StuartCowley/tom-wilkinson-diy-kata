/* CODE EXPLANATION 

Starting with an array of objects and want to concatenate the names together in to a string 
First function returns an array of the names - orginally also had a split here which returned
each name within their own array but found this was unecessary
The String(names) function is required here as you cannot do a split on an array - must be a string 
The split join returns a string which now has a space after each comma 
The final return is the RegEx which replaces the final comma with an &
